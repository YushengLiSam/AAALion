## 2026-06-09 — v0.2.0: in-app 中英 language toggle, signed JWT, demo hardening

**by**: 管图杰 (JackGuan99) · CI-verified (iOS Simulator Build + RAG Eval green) · backend auto-deployed to `main`

App version **0.1.0 → 0.2.0** (build **1 → 2**) — `MARKETING_VERSION` /
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `client/AAALionApp/project.yml`. First bump since
the project was named; backend changes are backward-compatible so installed
0.1.0 builds keep working unchanged.

- **In-app language toggle (中文 / English)** — a Settings → Language picker
  switches the whole UI *and the assistant's reply language* at runtime, no
  relaunch (runtime `Bundle` override + root `.id(lang)` rebuild). 313/356
  user-facing strings localized via `en.lproj` / `zh-Hans.lproj` generated from
  the source literals; `Lf(...)` handles interpolated/dynamic strings. Backend:
  `/chat/stream` takes an optional `language` (defaults to `zh`) → replies in
  that language. **Old installs omit it and keep getting Chinese — no break.**
- **Real signed session token** — login now also issues a signed, expiring
  **HS256 JWT** (`jwt` field) verifiable via `POST /auth/verify`; the opaque
  `token == user_id` demo path is untouched and clients ignore the extra field.
  Stdlib-only, zero new deps (`server/app/services/jwt_session.py`).
- **Demo reliability** — network-resilient chat stream (explicit timeout +
  auto-retry + friendly error state); `tools/warm-demo.py` (measured cold→warm
  first-token **≈16×**: 15-18s → ~1s); `docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md` +
  `docs/DEFENSE_DECK_OUTLINE.md`.
- **Bug fix (retrieval)** — English/brand product-line names (iPhone/iPad/
  AirPods…) now pin to 数码电子, so a multi-turn opener "推荐 iPhone" → "再便宜
  点的" keeps the aisle (`_category`/`_sub_categories` casefold-match). 43
  server tests pass.
- **Tracked separately** — negation phrased "不要X的Y" ("不要苹果的耳机") returns
  0 cards; spun off as a background fix task. The demo uses the working comma
  form "推荐降噪耳机,不要苹果".

## 2026-06-01 — R10.2: clarification, eval hardening, Markdown, image fix, CD bugfix, device deploy

**by**: Yusheng · all live-verified on cloud + device

Continuation of the R10 round; all merged to `main` and auto-deployed.

- **#5 主动反问 (proactive clarification)** — vague first-turn requests
  ("推荐个礼物" / "随便看看" / "送女友什么礼物") now make the agent **ask a
  clarifying question** instead of dumping products: a conservative backend
  detector (`_needs_clarification`) skips retrieval/cards and swaps in a
  `_CLARIFY_PROMPT`. The backend emits a `clarify` SSE event with **tappable
  quick-reply chips** (gift → 对象/预算/场合; generic → 品类/预算); tapping
  one sends it as the next turn. Live-verified: vague → ask + chips, all
  concrete/negation/compare queries unaffected (no misfire).
- **P2 — eval hardening** — added 6 adversarial negation/multi-turn golden
  cases (golden.jsonl 76→82), each live-verified to exclude the forbidden
  products before adding. Headline: persistent negation (防晒→不要日系→再便宜
  点 still drops the Japanese 安热沙). **negation accuracy held at 1.000 over
  20 cases (doubled)**; recall@5 0.932 on the 82-case set.
- **P1 — RUBRIC_MAPPING refresh** — the mapping had gone stale (listed 4.1
  cart as "deferred", 4.4 cache as "partial" when both are shipped). Rewrote
  it to current reality with verification tags.
- **Markdown rendering** — assistant replies showed raw markdown (pipe-and-
  dash tables, literal `##`/`**`). New `MarkdownMessageView` renders
  headings/tables/bold/bullets as real SwiftUI views while preserving the
  `[目录✓]`/`[推断?]` provenance coloring; no markdown dependency.
- **Image-path fix** — seed image paths contain Chinese category folders
  (`/static/1_美妆护肤/…`); emitted un-encoded, iOS `URL(string:)` failed to
  load them intermittently. Backend now `quote()`s the path → all images
  200 via the tunnel. Backend-only fix; no reinstall needed.
- **`/cache/stats` now surfaces the retrieval cache** (proposal P3) — was
  response-cache only; merged `retrieval_cache_stats()` in (back-compat) +
  an iOS Settings row showing the retrieval hit-rate (the 8s→0.3s win).
- **CD bugfix** — the autodeploy ready-check waited only 40 s, but warmup
  under load hits ~60 s, so it **false-rolled-back a good commit and marked
  it bad**. Widened to 150 s; re-verified end-to-end (push → auto-deploy →
  `deploy OK`, no rollback).
- **Device deploy** — 狮选 installed on iPhone 12 Pro Max + iPad Air (5th
  gen) for live testing (free Personal Team, team `C3Y9PC45F8`).

## 2026-05-30 (later) — R10.perf: first-screen speed + conversational cart + UX polish

**by**: Yusheng (perf + client) · verified on cloud by Shufeng

Yusheng landed a full performance + client-experience round, auto-deployed
to the cloud (`123ef1b`). Verified live 2026-05-30:

- **4.1 conversational quantity change** — "把第二个改成3个" → cloud returns
  `{"type":"cart_intent","action":"set_quantity","index":2,"quantity":3}`
  ✅; iOS updates the cart without tapping +/−. Backend regex + iOS link.
- **4.4 首屏极速 (sub-second first screen)** — product cards now stream
  **before** the LLM text (verified: 5 `product_card` events arrive before
  any `delta` ✅; pure reorder, recall unchanged). Plus keep-alive LLM
  connection + rerank candidate trimming. Measured by Yusheng: cache-hit
  0.3 s, skip-rerank 0.14 s, cold 0.14–2.2 s (was 4–14 s, behind the whole
  AI segment).
- **4.4 client polish** — skeleton shimmer cards on send; favorite ❤️
  (spring + haptics, local persist, `FavoritesStore`); cart swipe
  (left-delete / right-favorite). New files `SkeletonCardView.swift`,
  `FavoritesStore.swift`.
- **rerank cost knobs** (`RERANK_INPUT_CAP` / `RERANK_MAX_LENGTH`) — cloud
  3.8× faster (7884→2059 ms); golden recall@5 0.964→0.941, MRR flat,
  negation 1.000 — quality holds, one-env-var rollback.
- **Auto-deploy CD** — `lionpick-autodeploy.timer` git-fetches every ~2 min
  and `reset --hard` + restart + `/ready` check with rollback. A merge to
  main is live on the cloud hands-free within ~2 min. (Corrects the earlier
  "tarball" note — the VM is a git clone.)

Demo tip (Yusheng): pre-run the demo phrases into cache → 0.3 s first
screen on stage. Cold-query LLM ~1.5 s is the network floor on CPU-only
cloud (GPU only helps rerank, which the cache already skips).

Open: `retrieval_cache_stats()` still not wired into `/cache/stats`
(cosmetic); stable cloud domain still pending (tunnel URL ephemeral);
Tujie's Docker docs branch still not merged to main.

## 2026-05-30 — R10 accounts + backend goes to the cloud ☁️

**by**: Shufeng (accounts) + Yusheng (cloud infra, RAG cache)

### Backend is now cloud-hosted (Yusheng)

The FastAPI backend now runs on a **GCP VM** (4 vCPU / 15 GB),
`systemd`-managed (auto-start on boot, auto-restart on crash), exposed
over public HTTPS via a **Cloudflare tunnel**. No more "whose Mac is on
the same WiFi" — anyone with internet can reach it.

- Public base URL (⚠️ **ephemeral** — a tunnel restart changes it;
  Yusheng re-broadcasts on change):
  `https://actions-funeral-treating-trigger.trycloudflare.com`
- Auto-generated Swagger UI: **`/docs`** (clickable, live).
- iOS connects automatically — `Config.swift` `defaultBackendURL` was
  pointed at the tunnel (`c2eb98e`). `git pull main` → build → done.
  (If you ever hand-typed a URL into Settings, long-press the gear 1.5 s
  → dev mode → clear it.)
- Endpoint map: `GET /health` `GET /ready` `POST /chat/stream`
  `GET /products` `GET /cache/stats` `GET /currency/rate`
  `POST /repurchase/purchase` `GET /repurchase/reminders`
  + R10: `/auth/*` `/groupbuy/*` `/preferences/*` `/price_watch/*`.
- Perf note: first hit of a fresh query ~10 s (retrieval cold), repeats
  ~2 s (cache). Chinese queries fast; English routes through the
  multilingual reranker and can be 30 s+ — **demo in Chinese**.

### R10 accounts (Shufeng — `9679d65`, `1117195`)

Two sign-in methods + a **pluggable cloud seam** so Yusheng can own the
real user service later: `UserStore` protocol + `get_user_store()`
factory switched by `USER_STORE_BACKEND=local|cloud`. Local demo backend
= SQLite + mocked SMS (code shown on screen, no real send). iOS:
`LoginView`, `AuthService`, `AuthState`; `DeviceIdentity.userId` returns
the **account id when signed in** so every feature (preferences /
group-buy / price-watch / repurchase / chat preference-prior) re-keys to
the account, with one-time migration of anonymous device data.

### R10 group-buy polish (Shufeng — `1117195`)

拼单 success state is now a real **去支付** button → adds product to cart
→ opens CheckoutView. Invite shares clean text + a `LP-XXXXX` join code
(not the old backend JSON URL) + a 复制邀请 copy fallback.

### R10.bugfix (Shufeng — `46e1e6b`) — found on iPhone, fixed

1. **Signed-in users 400'd on 拼单 / preferences / price-watch /
   repurchase.** The route `user_id` regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{8,64}$`
   rejected the `:` in `phone:…` / `apple:…`. Widened to
   `^[A-Za-z0-9_:.@\-]{8,64}$` in all four routes.
2. **👍/👎 highlight reset on leaving a product.** `prefSignal` was
   transient `@State`; now persisted per `(userId, productId)` in
   UserDefaults (server score was always durable).
3. **"SMS-code-on-screen feels fake."** Added **email/phone + password**
   auth (`POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/password/login`;
   `pbkdf2_hmac sha256` 100k-iter, 16-byte salt). LoginView gained a
   segmented 密码 / 短信 / Apple picker (password default).

> **⚠️ ACTION FOR YUSHENG**: the cloud VM is still on `c2eb98e` (old
> code). Until it `git pull && systemctl restart` to **`46e1e6b`**,
> signed-in users 400 on those four features and password auth 404s.
> Verified live 2026-05-30: cloud `/auth/register` → 404, signed-in
> `/groupbuy/create` → 400.

### Yusheng's RAG retrieval cache — on `origin/Yusheng`, not yet merged

`008238b`: memoizes the expensive preference-independent retrieval
pipeline (hybrid + cross-encoder rerank); 5287× on a repeat query in his
measurement; preserves the live 👍/👎 reorder (no `user_id` in the cache
key). Pending a local spot-check + eval before FF to main. Not on the
cloud yet either.

## 2026-05-25 night — R8 + R8.D + R8.E (post-Tujie `2f9b6c4`)

**by**: Shufeng

After Tujie's last main-merge at `2f9b6c4` (stateful constraints + Docker
prewarm), Shufeng landed 7 commits across three sub-rounds.

### R8 core (`672c6fc`, `bcfb8ab`)

- iOS Settings: live "缓存命中率" panel polling `/cache/stats` every 10 s
  (surfaces Sam's R7e endpoint that was previously unused on the client).
- Multi-turn negation persistence: `Filter.exclude_keywords` now carries
  across turns via `constraint_state.py` merge — `"推荐防晒霜不要日系"` →
  `"再便宜点的呢"` now excludes JP brands on turn 2.
- Brand-origin coverage extended to KR / DE / GB. `"不要韩系 / 英系 /
  德系"` now hard-filters.
- Golden audit spot-check: confirmed Sam/Tujie's `negation_accuracy=1.000`
  came from real label corrections (not cherry-picking).
- 9 demo screenshots + sidecar `.md` under `docs/demos/2026-05-25-evening/`.

### R8.D — public deployment (`417f840`, `a22ce7d`)

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** exposes `localhost:8000` as
  `https://reader-missile-absolute-memphis.trycloudflare.com`.
  iPhone connects from any network (cellular, public Wi-Fi, hotel SSID)
  with zero LAN setup. `Config.swift` bakes the tunnel URL.
- **Dev-mode gesture**: long-press the gear icon for 1.5 s flips
  `@AppStorage("lionpick.devMode")`; the backend-URL editor in Settings
  is hidden by default and only appears in dev mode. Visual feedback:
  `gearshape` → `gearshape.fill` (amber) when ON.
- **Voice cross-session fix** (`a22ce7d`): `SFSpeechRecognitionTask`
  leaks one final callback after `cancel()`. `sessionID` guard +
  `task.finish()` (instead of `cancel()`) + defensive draft clear in
  `startListening` close the `"toy + cosmetic = 'toys and cosmetic'"`
  bug.

### R8.E — iOS UX parity with ChatGPT / Claude (`1a32a79`, `c14972c`, `0eb143a`)

- **Voice idle-timer auto-stop**, 1.8 s threshold on the main RunLoop in
  `.common` modes. Same-text partials suppressed via `lastTranscript`
  guard so ambient noise doesn't extend the window. `onStop` callback
  syncs the ViewModel's UI-bound flag when the timer fires.
  Composer shows `"正在听… / Listening — 停顿 ~2 秒自动结束"`.
- **Multi-attachment up to 10** (photos + files + camera, mixed). New
  `Attachment` struct (`kind: .photo/.camera/.file`, MIME sniffed from
  magic bytes). Composer horizontal scroll-row of 64×64 chips with
  x-delete and "N/10" counter. Message bubble renders a 2-row
  `LazyVGrid` (5 per row, 96×96) above text.
- **PhotosPicker selection bug**: plural `PhotosPicker` inline in a
  `Menu` had a SwiftUI binding bug. Switched to
  `.photosPicker(isPresented:)` modifier on the NavigationStack; Menu
  now just sets a flag.
- **Image downsample on upload**: `Attachment.compressForUpload` resizes
  to 1280 px on the longest edge and re-encodes JPEG @ 0.78.
  Typical 4032×3024 iPhone photo: 2.4 MB → ~120 KB (20× shrink).
- **Backend async-offload**: `top_k_image()` and `top_k()` now run inside
  `asyncio.to_thread()` so the FastAPI event loop stays responsive
  during retrieval. This was why `/cache/stats` timed out during a
  multi-image chat — single-worker uvicorn was being event-loop-
  blocked by sync torch calls. Cache stats fetch timeout also
  bumped from 15 s → 60 s as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Backend multi-image**: `_extract_image_bytes` →
  `_extract_image_bytes_list` (cap 10). CLIP retriever still uses
  `imgs[0]` (single-image visual retriever); LLM sees all images via
  the content array. Cache key uses `hash_image_bytes_list` (sorted
  SHA concat) so order doesn't matter.

### Quality numbers

Unchanged from R7.3 merge (R8 work was UX + infra, not retrieval):
- `recall@5 = 0.880`, `MRR = 0.828` (audited 59-case set)
- `negation_accuracy = 1.000`
- self-assessed **~91-92 / 100**

### What's open going into R9

- Demo video (3-5 min QuickTime screencast)
- Defense slide deck (Gamma prompt is in `docs/defense/gamma-prompt.md`)
- Phase 2 cloud VM deploy (Hetzner CX22, ~2026-06-05)
- Chroma snapshot zip on Drive for team-internal distribution
